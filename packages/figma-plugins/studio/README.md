# Figma Plugin - Ceros Studio

This package contains source code for [Figma Plugin named Ceros Studio](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1220032162657897733/Ceros-Studio)

At this time, plugin development and testing needs to be done using the Figma desktop app. This is because Figma needs to read your code saved as a local file. The Figma desktop app can be downloaded [here](https://www.figma.com/downloads/).

If you already have the desktop app, please make sure to update to the latest version, as several features have been added specifically in order to provide a better plugin development experience.

Log in to your account and open the file editor in the Figma desktop app
You can open any existing document or create a new one.

Go to `Menu` > `Plugins` > `Development` > `Import plugin from manifest...`

And locate `manifest.json` file in the root of this repository, which should start Studio Plugin.
